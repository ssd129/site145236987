Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method for multi-parameter optimization which also uses population-based approach. A population (swarm) of candidate solutions (particles) moves in the search space, and the movement of the particles is influenced both by their own best known position and swarm's global best known position. PSO is often more computationally efficient especially in unconstrained problems with continuous variables.

A very simple PSO code can be obtained with an example in MATLAB environment to this [link](http://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/particle-swarm-optimization-algorithm.html).
