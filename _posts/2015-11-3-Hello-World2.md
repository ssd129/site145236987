Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method for multi-parameter optimization which also uses population-based approach. A population (swarm) of candidate solutions (particles) moves in the search space, and the movement of the particles is influenced both by their own best known position and swarm's global best known position. Like genetic algorithms, the PSO method depends on information sharing among population members. In some problems the PSO is often more computationally efficient than the GAs, especially in unconstrained problems with continuous variables.

A very simple PSO codes can be obtained with an example in MATLAB environment to this [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296636431_Codes_in_MATLAB_for_Particle_Swarm_Optimization).
