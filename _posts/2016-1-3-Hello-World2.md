 An mathematical optimization problem is the problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions. Optimization problems can be divided into two categories depending on whether the variables are continuous or discrete. An optimization problem with discrete variables is known as a combinatorial optimization problem. In a combinatorial optimization problem, we are looking for an object such as an integer, permutation or graph from a finite (or possibly countable infinite) set. Problems with continuous variables include the constrained problems is the problems of optimizing objective functions with respect to some variables in the presence of constraints on those variables and the  multimodal problems which deals with optimization tasks that involve finding all or most of the multiple (at least locally optimal) solutions of a problem.

To solve problems, researchers may use algorithms that terminate in a finite number of steps, or iterative methods that converge to a solution (on some specified class of problems), or heuristics that may provide approximate solutions to some problems (although their iterates need not converge).

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method for multi-parameter optimization which also uses population-based approach. A population (swarm) of candidate solutions (particles) moves in the search space, and the movement of the particles is influenced both by their own best known position and swarm's global best known position. PSO is often more computationally efficient especially in unconstrained problems with continuous variables.

A very simple PSO code can be obtained with an example in MATLAB environment to this [link](http://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/particle-swarm-optimization-algorithm.html).


Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) studies artificial systems that take inspiration from the behavior of real ant colonies and which are used to solve constrained problems with discrete variables optimization problems (which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs).
