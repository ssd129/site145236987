title: Classification of Mathematical Optimization Problems and Algorithms.

 An mathematical optimization problem is the problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions. Optimization problems can be divided into categories depending on whether the variables and the constraints of objective functions.
 
 * variables are continuous  or discrete (combinatorial optimization problem).
 * constraints are constrained or unconstrained.

To solve problems, researchers may use algorithms that terminate in a finite number of steps, or iterative methods that converge to a solution (on some specified class of problems), or heuristics that may provide approximate solutions to some problems (although their iterates need not converge).

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method for multi-parameter optimization which also uses population-based approach. A population (swarm) of candidate solutions (particles) moves in the search space, and the movement of the particles is influenced both by their own best known position and swarm's global best known position. PSO is often more computationally efficient especially in unconstrained problems with continuous variables.

A very simple PSO code can be obtained with an example in MATLAB environment to this [link](http://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/particle-swarm-optimization-algorithm.html).

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) studies artificial systems that take inspiration from the behavior of real ant colonies and which are used to solve constrained problems with discrete variables optimization problems (which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs).
