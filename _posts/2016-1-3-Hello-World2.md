title: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm.
---

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) studies artificial systems that take inspiration from the behavior of real ant colonies and which are used to solve constrained problems with discrete variables optimization problems (which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs).

A very simple PSO code can be obtained with an example in MATLAB environment to this [link](http://www.aco-metaheuristic.org/aco-code/).
